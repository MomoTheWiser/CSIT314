CSIT314 - Unit Testing

The program can be executed using VSCode using Windows 10.
In order to execute test cases, you must install the following pre-requisites:

1. CMake and CMake tools via VSCode
2. C/C++ (VSCode Extension)

If you encounter errors with CMake path. Ensure your settings are correct, check main page of CMake via VSCode. 
Or, download from https://cmake.org/

## Build set-up.

1. Configure CMake with a C/C++ compiler. This may be mwing/Visual Studio 2019 x86/x64 architecture.
2. Press F7 to build.

If you encounter errors with building. My only solution so far is to reconfigure your compiler with another C/C++ compiler.

Create TestCases within Test Folder.

Documnetation of test case creation can be found [here](https://google.github.io/googletest/).

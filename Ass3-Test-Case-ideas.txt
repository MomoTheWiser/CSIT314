TestCase

1. Opening a file
    Inserting test cases with inserting the right file names

2. Opening a non-existent file

3. Possibly use sample data as a verifying data????

4. Create a test case to see if astar chooses correct heuristics distance
    That is, create a sample test data where it splits the path into 2 paths.
    1 path should weight more in total than the other path.
    However, create data so that heaviest path costs the least when the journey is early.

5. Test makeheap and siftUp
    4.1 Test the siftUp
    4.2 Test the makeheap

6. Test incorrect input data
    5.1 File that doesn't specify vertices + edges
    5.2 File where no. of vertices != vertices listed
    5.3 File where no. of edges != edges listed
    5.4 Where the file doesn't specify start or end goal

7. Cycle in the graph - this will cause infinite data and program to loop?

8. Graph that isn't completed
